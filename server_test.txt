Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple, 
lightweight file transfer protocol used for transferring files between devices over a network.
It operates on UDP port 69 and is commonly used in scenarios where a minimalistic and efficient file transfer method is required.

Unlike FTP, TFTP lacks authentication 
scenarios where minimal overhead is required. Unlike FTP, TFTP lacks authentication and encryption, making it unsuitable for secure file transfers but ideal
for network booting, firmware updates, and configuration file transfers. It follows a block-based
blocks (typically 512 bytes), and each block must be acknowledged before the next one is sent. Due to its simplicity, TFTP is commonly used in PXE boot environments 
to load operating systems onto diskle and in networking devices like routers and switches for firmware upgrades. However, its lack of security features and reliance 
on UDP make it vulnerable to packet loss and unauthorized access, limiting its use in modern secure environments.onfi
